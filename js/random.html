		    Is there a relationship between having a Wikipedia page and receiving an award under the Order? Does Wikipedia page creation follow the Honours announcement, or does getting an Honours follow having a page Wikipedia? Wikipedia biographies  created before the announcement of the award versus pages created or on/after the announcement date is 31% v 69%. However, this figure is skewed by the inclusion of awards granted 1975-2001 before Wikipedia was founded. If we only account for those who received an award after the start of Wikipedia in 2001 the ratio is 54% v 46%. 
		
		
		  </p>
		  
		<p class="second">
		Measuring the time between the date of the honour and the date of page creation shows a startling result: there is a discernible spike in page creation in the week the awards are announced.  As illustrated in the chart below, where “Week 0” as the day of the award plus six days, the Order announcement appears to serve as a signal of an individual’s notability for Wikipedia page editors. This increase in page creation during “Week 0” is seen across all order levels; especially for Officers and Members. The heat map shows page creation activity for the weeks leading up to and after the announcement week for each level of the honours.

					Digging into the text of an Honour citation tells us more about the profile of those who receive a Wikipedia page before they receive an Order of Australia, and the profile of those who receive a page after they are honoured. 
					Women who have a Wikipedia page before they are awarded an Order of Australia, tend to be notable for sport and athletics, entertainment and media, and politics. Their notability for Wikipedia editors appears to be established before they receive their Honour.

					Those who have a page created for them after they receive an Order of Australia, tend to be honoured for their work in nursing, community health, paediatrics, aged care and disability services. Receiving an Order of Australia for these women, appears to be a signal to Wikipedia editors that they are notable, and therefore deserve recognition via a page.

This chart shows the frequency words used in the Order of Australia citations awarded to women who also have a wikipedia page. Words plotted under the line on the right hand side tend to be more used in citations of women who have their page created <i>after </i>they receieve their Order of Australia, and those above the line to the right tend ot be words used in citations for  women who have their page created <i>before</i> they receive an honour.  The chart uses a log scale, and the points plotted are slightly "jittered" to remove occlusion.

		    Despite this effect, still not everyone gets a page created once they receive an award, even if they hold an Order of Australia. People like Johnstone and Fragar who have been recognised for “distinguished service of a high degree to Australia or to humanity at large”, go unrecognised on Wikipedia, despite sufficient published and recognised work for suitable referencing.

		    <div class="para">
		    
		
		  <p class="first">
		Both the Order of Australia and Wikipedia need to improve their recognition of women across a range of contribution categories. 
		
		In 2020 almost 42% of Order recipients were women and the Honour a Woman project seeks to make this 50% by supporting more nominations and highlighting structural barriers to inclusion. But these figures mask the disparities that persist when it comes to recognition of women in the Australian Honours system. This study has shown that women tend to receive fewer awards in the higher Order categories. Equity needs to be reached across the full range of awards.
		
		For Wikipedia too, a gender gap persists. A number of initiatives have been created to address this issue, including Women in Red, Women in Green, Wiki Loves Women, WikiGap, WikiWomen’s Collaborative, WikiHerStory, Editona, and non-profit organisations such as Art+Feminism or 500 Women Scientists. But while these initiatives have focused on including more women in the biographical pages of Wikipedia, this study shows that women recognised for particular types of labour need to be prioritised.  
		
		
		
		
		  </p>
		  
		<p class="second">
		Finally, in conducting this study, we found that for both Wikipedia and the Order of Australia, data about female and male genders is much more accessible than data about race, ethnicity and the full spectrum of gender. For the Order of Australia, the lack of Indigenous recognition with the continued presentation of the awards on 26 January (the “Australia Day” public holiday contested by many to Indigenous Australians because of its memorialisation of the “discovery” of Australia by Captain Cook and the subsequent colonisation and destruction of Inigenous communities it set in train) is unchanged. For Wikipedia, the lack of recognition of topics outside the purview of male, Western editors has not seen any significant change either. The availability of data tracking identifying elements is critical to noticing and addressing these issues.
