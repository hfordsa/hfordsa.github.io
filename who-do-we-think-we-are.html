		   Dr Megan-Jane Johnstone and Dr Lyn Fragar are both recipients of an Order of Australia. Johnstone is an Officer of the Order of Australia and received their award in 2019 for <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2004614" target="_blank">“… distinguished service to medical education in the field of nursing and health care ethics, to patients' rights, and to professional standards.”</a> Fragar is also an Officer of the Order of Australia (2002) and their citation is <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1132163" target="_blank">for pioneering services to rural health care</a>. Johnstone has an <a href="https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1132163">entry on Wikidata </a>(Wikidata is a sister project of Wikipedia that stores some of its data) and her work is cited on the Wikipedia topic page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorality" target="_blank"> Amorality</a>. Fragar has a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42836150" target ="_blank">reference in Wikidata</a> and is flagged for page creation via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Missing_articles_by_identifier/NLA" target="_blank">the Women in Red project</a> which aims to create more Wikipedia pages about women (or, in Wikipedia parlance, to “turn red links into blue ones”). Despite these recognitions, however, neither Johnstone nor Fragar have a Wikipedia page. 
		  </p>
		    
		
		  <p class="second">
		    Biographies (pages) of women represent only 18% of all biographies on English Wikipedia. Australian women are marginally better represented, constituting approximately 20-22% of Australian biographies on Wikipedia . Johnstone and Fragar are part of a large group who have been recognised by The Order of Australia, but do not have similar recognition on Wikipedia. As we will see, representation of people on Wikipedia in the higher levels of the Order of Australia like the “Companion” award, is strong. At the lower levels of Officer or Member, however, representation is lacking. In this essay  we explore the relationship between the recognition accorded through the Australian Honours system and Wikipedia biography pages: who is likely to have a Wikipedia page? Who falls through the cracks?

		    Two worlds of notability collide
		  </h4>
		      </div>
		  <div class="para">
		    
		
		  <p class="first">
		    We examine the relationship between Wikipedia and the Order of Australia to understand who is recognised. It’s important to note that both systems have been criticised for their bias against minorities and under-recognised groups. A 1995 review into the Australian Honours  system outlined significant failings of the awards because of its gender and racial biases. Since its foundation in the 1970s, the number of honours announced every year has steadily increased more than fifteen-fold, from 105 in 1975 to 1,596 in 2020. As the number of Order of Australia recipients has increased, the proportion of women has doubled, from 21 or 21% of total honours in 1975, to 649 or 42% in 2020. <br>The Honour a Woman project has played an important role in increasing the number of women nominated and awarded an Order, but there is still a way to go. And, while the gender of a recipient can easily be determined, the data provided by the Order means that understanding the cultural or racial representation amongst Honour recipients is more difficult. 
		    While we recognise the limitations in using this data set as a comparison for notability, it nonetheless affords insights into the mechanisms through which distinction and recognition is produced on Wikipedia. <br>The celebration of Wikipedia’s 20th birthday in January 2021, is a good opportunity to look back and understand “blindspots” in past editorial focuses, and to help target appropriate institutions or groups that Wikipedia or Wikimedia initiatives could focus on for engagement to help create pages for under-represented but notable groups of Australians. 
		
		
		  </p>
		  
		<p class="second">
		  We estimate that there are 53,569 pages in Wikipedia that relate to people connected to Australia, compared to 41,330 people who hold an Order of Australia. Notability on each platform is measured in a different way. The Order receives public nominations but convenes a panel of representatives to judge a person’s merit based on service or contribution. <br>Wikipedia’s definition of notability is different. It judges a person’s notability according to external signals. According to policy, people are notable when they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Subject-specific_notability_guidelines" target="_blank">“…have gained sufficiently significant attention by the world at large and over a period of time”</a>, and when that attention can be verified according to what editors regard as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability#Subject-specific_notability_guidelines" target="_blank"> "reliable sources". </a> Rather than deliberating in a panel about who should be recognised, Wikipedia editors determine notability individually and try to reach consensus with others when there are disputes. Also: a person does not need to have made a significant contribution, but instead needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(people)" target="_blank">"remarkable"</a> to have a Wikipedia page. While the Order of Australia focuses on those who have rendered service to the nation, Wikipedia has a wider latitude to also include people who operate more on the fringe - indeed, it even includes some Australians who have had their Order removed because of a criminal conviction.<br>
		While each system has a different system for measuring “notability”, we were interested in how much overlap exists between the two. What we have found is that this overlap is relatively small. There are 4,452 people who have both a Wikipedia page and hold an Order of Australia. Only 11% of all Order recipients have a Wikipedia biography. Given that Wikipedia page creation relies on external forms of verification, we set out to explore this relationship in more depth.

					    Is there a relationship between having a Wikipedia page and receiving an award under the Order? Does Wikipedia page creation follow the Honours announcement, or does getting an Honours follow having a page Wikipedia? Wikipedia biographies  created before the announcement of the award versus pages created or on/after the announcement date is 31% v 69%. However, this figure is skewed by the inclusion of awards granted 1975-2001 before Wikipedia was founded. If we only account for those who received an award after the start of Wikipedia in 2001 the ratio is 54% v 46%. Measuring the time between the date of the honour and the date of page creation shows a startling result: there is a discernible spike in page creation in the week the awards are announced.
					
					
					  </p>
					  
					<p class="second">
					  As illustrated in the chart below, where “Week 0” as the day of the award plus six days, the Order announcement appears to serve as a signal of an individual’s notability for Wikipedia page editors. The dot plot shows honour recipeints who have receieved their award ater the start of Wikipedia in January, 2001. The increase in page creation during “Week 0” is also seen across all order levels; especially for Officers and Members. The heat map shows page creation activity for the weeks leading up to and after the announcement week for each level of the honours.

						What does this tell us about who we think we are?

						Challenges and opportunities for both the Order of Australia and Wikipedia    
				</h5>
				  

		</div>
		  
		    <div class="para">
		    
		
		  <p class="first">
		Both the Order of Australia and Wikipedia need to improve their recognition of women across a range of contribution categories. 
		
		In 2020 almost 42% of Order recipients were women and the Honour a Woman project seeks to make this 50% by supporting more nominations and highlighting structural barriers to inclusion. But these figures mask the disparities that persist when it comes to recognition of women in the Australian Honours system. This study has shown that women tend to receive fewer awards in the higher Order categories. Equity needs to be reached across the full range of awards.
		
		For Wikipedia too, a gender gap persists. A number of initiatives have been created to address this issue, including Women in Red, Women in Green, Wiki Loves Women, WikiGap, WikiWomen’s Collaborative, WikiHerStory, Editona, and non-profit organisations such as Art+Feminism or 500 Women Scientists. But while these initiatives have focused on including more women in the biographical pages of Wikipedia, this study shows that women recognised for particular types of labour need to be prioritised.  
		
		
		
		
		  </p>
		  
		<p class="second">
		Finally, in conducting this study, we found that for both Wikipedia and the Order of Australia, data about female and male genders is much more accessible than data about race, ethnicity and the full spectrum of gender. For the Order of Australia, the lack of Indigenous recognition with the continued presentation of the awards on 26 January (the “Australia Day” public holiday contested by many to Indigenous Australians because of its memorialisation of the “discovery” of Australia by Captain Cook and the subsequent colonisation and destruction of Inigenous communities it set in train) is unchanged. For Wikipedia, the lack of recognition of topics outside the purview of male, Western editors has not seen any significant change either. The availability of data tracking identifying elements is critical to noticing and addressing these issues.
