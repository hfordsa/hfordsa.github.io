		  About the project
		</h4>  
		
		<p>
		This essay forms part of a pilot for the project “Who do we think we are?” to explore how Wikipedia represents Australia. This pilot project focuses on how Wikipedia represents Order of Australia recipients over the course of Wikipedia’s twenty year history. It is the result of a partnership between UTS Researchers, Heather Ford and Tamson Pietsch, data analyst and visualisation designer, Kelly Tall and Wikimedia Australia volunteers, Alex Lum, Toby Hudson and Pru Mitchell.
